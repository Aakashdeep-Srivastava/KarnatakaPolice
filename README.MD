# Police Performance and Resource Management üöìüí°

## Problem Statement
Effective police performance assessments and resource allocation are hindered by a lack of comprehensive data-driven insights. The challenge is to create a solution that provides actionable insights for strategic decision-making while tracking key performance indicators across different police units and locations.

## Introduction
- **Police Stations**: Fundamental units within the Police Department.
- **Leadership Levels**:
  - **Police Sub-Inspector (PSI)**: Frontline leadership.
  - **Police Inspector (PI)**: Supervises station operations.
  - **Deputy Superintendent of Police (DySP)**: Oversees day-to-day responsibilities.
- **Complexity**: Monitoring activities at each level is challenging due to the range of duties and responsibilities.
- **Categorization**:
  - **Themes**: Law & Order, Crime, Station Management, Investigation, Court Monitoring.
  - **Sub-themes**: Specific work items defined for each category.

## Expected Solution
- **Analytical Dashboard**:
  - Combination of tables, bars, and charts.
  - Display themes and sub-themes at the police station level.
- **Aggregation**:
  - Grouping of police stations.
  - Aggregated data for PIs and DySPs/ACPs.
- **Automated Data Updates**:
  - Fetch data from various sources (PoliceIT, IRAD, etc.).
- **Progress Tracking**:
  - Indicate work item progress.
  - Automated alerts for non-completion.
- **Manpower Mapping**:
  - Weekly duty roster/chart for staff and officers.
